How-To Guides

Add a how-to guide when you're documenting the steps to solve a specific, common problem. These are short, focused checklists for developers who already know the basics.

When to write one: Answering a specific question like "How do I add a custom tool?" or "How do I configure retries?".

Think: A recipe to solve one problem.
