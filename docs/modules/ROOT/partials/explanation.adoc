Explanations
Write an explanation when you need to provide context, discuss design decisions, or clarify a complex concept. This is about building a deeper understanding of the "why."

When to write one: To explain the architecture of a new service, the trade-offs of a protocol decision, or the theory behind an algorithm.

Think: An architecture design record (ADR) or a conceptual overview.
