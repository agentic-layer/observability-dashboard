Tutorials
Update or create a tutorial when you need to guide a newcomer through a complete, simple project from start to finish. This is for first-time learning and should guarantee a successful result.

When to write one: Documenting the primary "happy path" for a major new feature.

Think: "Your first agent" or a "getting started" guide.
