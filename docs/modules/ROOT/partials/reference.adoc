Reference
Update reference material when you add or change code, configuration, or data schemas. This is the technical source of truth.

When to write one: As you modify a function, class, API endpoint, or A2A message schema. This is often done directly in the code via docstrings that are auto-generated into docs.

Think: A dictionary or encyclopedia entry for your code.
